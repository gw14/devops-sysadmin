# What makes a good personal tutor (context)

A great personal tutor does more than relay facts — they create conditions for understanding, skill, and independence. This document summarizes core qualities, effective practices, session structure, evaluation guidance, and tips for both tutors and learners.

## Core qualities
- Strong subject knowledge: accurate, up-to-date understanding of the topic.  
- Pedagogical skill: knows how people learn and can break complex ideas into manageable steps.  
- Clear communication: uses examples, analogies, and checks for understanding.  
- Empathy & patience: listens, respects the learner’s pace, and reduces anxiety.  
- Adaptability: changes approach to match strengths, gaps, and learning preferences.  
- Feedback orientation: gives timely, specific, actionable feedback.  
- Reliability & professionalism: punctual, prepared, and consistent.  
- Motivating: builds confidence and persistence.

## Effective teaching practices
- Diagnose first: assess prior knowledge and misconceptions before teaching new material.  
- Set goals: short-term and long-term goals that are specific and measurable.  
- Chunk & scaffold: present material in small steps, gradually fading support.  
- Prioritize active learning: problems, retrieval practice, worked examples, and spaced review.  
- Socratic questioning: ask guiding questions to promote reasoning and discovery.  
- Frequent checks for understanding: quick problems, summaries, teach-back.  
- Low-stakes practice: short problems or flashcards to build fluency.  
- Metacognitive coaching: teach planning, monitoring, and reflection skills.  
- Customize resources: adapt exercises, visuals, and difficulty.

## One-session structure (30–60 min)
1. Quick review (5–10 min): recap + check homework.  
2. Diagnostic check (3–5 min): short problem to find sticking points.  
3. Teach one focused concept (10–20 min): explain and model thinking.  
4. Guided practice (10–15 min): student works with coaching.  
5. Independent practice (5–10 min): student works with minimal help.  
6. Summarize & assign (3–5 min): takeaways and targeted homework.

## How to evaluate or pick a tutor
Ask about:
- Qualifications and relevant experience.
- Teaching approach and example lesson for topic X.
- How they assess progress and give feedback.
- Methods for handling misconceptions or stuck students.
- Availability, rates, cancellation policy, and references/sample plans.

## Red flags
- Mostly lectures without checks or adaptation.  
- Vague feedback (e.g., “do more practice”) without direction.  
- Overemphasis on memorization over conceptual understanding.  
- Inconsistency, frequent no-shows, or poor communication.

## Tips for tutors
- Start with an assessment and clear objectives.  
- Use varied formative assessments (mini-quizzes, oral checks).  
- Model problem-solving with think-alouds.  
- Encourage self-explanation and reflection.  
- Track progress and share it concisely.  
- Use empathy: ask about stressors, preferences, and motivation.

## Tips for learners
- Be honest about gaps and difficulties.  
- Do assigned practice — learning happens during practice.  
- Ask for worked examples and explanations of thinking, not just answers.  
- Teach back concepts in your own words to confirm understanding.

## Useful artifacts to keep in a tutoring folder
- Quick diagnostic template.  
- Session checklist and rubric.  
- Short bank of scaffolded exercises.  
- Homework templates with success criteria.  
- Progress log or skills checklist.
