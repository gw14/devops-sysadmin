# Tutoring plan context

This file summarizes the principles, components, templates, measurement methods, common pitfalls, differentiation strategies, and a quick checklist for designing effective tutoring plans.

## Core principles
- Start with outcomes: define what “success” looks like (SMART goals).  
- Diagnose first: base the plan on an assessment of current skills and misconceptions.  
- Sequence intentionally: order topics by dependencies and logical progression.  
- Make practice central: deliberate practice with feedback produces learning.  
- Scaffold and fade: provide support early and remove it as competence grows.  
- Measure frequently: use short formative checks to adapt pacing and content.  
- Be learner-centered: adapt to the student’s pace, interests, and motivations.

## Essential components of a plan
1. Clear goals (long-term and intermediate milestones).  
2. Initial diagnostic (test/interview/sample tasks).  
3. Curriculum map / scope & sequence with estimated time per unit.  
4. Session structure template (review → teach → guided practice → independent practice → summary/homework).  
5. Resources & materials (texts, problem sets, reference sheets, links).  
6. Practice plan & homework (targeted tasks with success criteria).  
7. Formative assessment & feedback loop (mini-quizzes, exit tickets).  
8. Progress tracking (logs, skills checklist, simple spreadsheet).  
9. Differentiation & remediation strategies.  
10. Logistics & communication (schedule, cancellation policy, reporting).  
11. Review & iteration checkpoints (every 2–4 weeks).

## One-session lesson template (30–60 min)
- Goal (1 sentence): measurable session objective.  
- Prep (tutor): materials and target errors.  
1. Quick review (5–10 min): check previous homework + short diagnostic.  
2. Set objective (1 min).  
3. Teach/demo (10–20 min): model thinking aloud.  
4. Guided practice (10–15 min): student works with coaching.  
5. Independent practice (5–10 min): student attempts problems alone.  
6. Summarize & reflect (3–5 min): student states takeaways and remaining question.  
- Homework: 2–4 targeted tasks with time estimate and rubric.

## Multi-week plan template (example: 8 weeks)
- Overall SMART goal (e.g., measurable performance target by week 8).  
- Week 0: diagnostic + baseline.  
- Weeks 1–2: foundations (definitions, notation, basics).  
- Weeks 3–4: core skills (procedures, common errors).  
- Week 5: application (mixed practice, contextual tasks).  
- Week 6: consolidation & extension (harder problems, fluency).  
- Week 7: assessment prep (review, exam strategies).  
- Week 8: summative assessment + next steps.

Example: beginner programming (twice-weekly 1-hour sessions) — map basics → control flow → collections → functions → I/O → testing → project → final evaluation.

## Measuring success (metrics)
- Formative: percent correct on mini-quizzes, time-to-complete tasks, rubric scores.  
- Summative: pre/post test improvement, project graded by rubric, teach-back demonstration.  
- Fluency: number of problems solved correctly under time or retention over spaced intervals.

## Common pitfalls & how to avoid them
- Overambitious scope: prioritize depth over breadth.  
- Vague homework: assign explicit exercises with success criteria.  
- Too much telling: maximize active practice.  
- No re-assessment: schedule checkpoints to adapt the plan.

## Differentiation ideas
- Faster learners: extension problems, mini-projects, greater complexity.  
- Struggling learners: more worked examples, step-by-step checklists, micro-goals.  
- Modalities: visual diagrams, spoken walkthroughs, interactive simulations, coding walkthroughs.

## Quick checklist before starting
- Is the goal measurable & time-bound?  
- Was a diagnostic performed?  
- Is the scope sequenced logically?  
- Does each session include active practice and a formative check?  
- Is homework explicit and targeted?  
- Are checkpoints & metrics defined?

## Red flags the plan isn’t working
- No measurable progress after 2–3 checkpoints.  
- Student reports persistent confusion or low confidence.  
- Homework not done or not improving performance.  
- Same errors repeated without targeted remediation.

## Next steps / templates to include in a tutoring folder
- Printable 8-week editable template.  
- Session plan template (fillable).  
- Diagnostic template and scoring rubric.  
- Homework assignment templates with success criteria.  
- Progress tracking spreadsheet (skills × date × score).
