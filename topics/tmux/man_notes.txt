session -> windows -> pane (pseudo terminal)
man pty(4)

session can be detached(ctrl-b d), it is still in the background,
it can be re-attached: "tmux attach"

server(process) -> client(different process)

config places:
/etc/tmux.conf        - system-wide config
~/.tmux.conf          - user config
tmux -f <config-path> - manual config file
the command :source: can upload a new config file while inside tmux.

relevant for now key-bindings: #c-b meaning ctrl-b
c-b " - split window horizontally into a new pane
c-b % - split window vertically into a new pane
c-b ; - go to the previously active pane
c-b o - go to the nect active pane

c-b c - create a new window
c-b , - rename window
c-b & - kill current window
c-b $ - rename session
c-b : - tmux command-prompt

c-b ? - list all key bindings

global command-queue (for commands in a config file)
command-queue1       (server->client1)
command-queue2       (server->client2)

each command is terminated with either a newline or semi-colon(;)

command terminated by a semi colon - form a **command_sequence**, if one command in the sequence
failes, all commands after it fail.

comments are marked with a starting hash :'#'

'\' charecter at the end of the line, joins between the current line to the next one.

$var gives the value of the variable 'var'.
'var=3' declares and sets 'var' to the value of 3 (can also use '%hidden var=3').


braces ({}) are parsed as a configuration file.
