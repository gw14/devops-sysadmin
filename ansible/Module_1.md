# **Module 1: Introduction to Ansible**  
**Duration:** ~1 Hour  
**Objective:** Understand the fundamentals of Ansible, its architecture, and use cases.  

---

## **Lesson 1.1: What is Ansible?**  
### **Key Concepts:**  
âœ… **Definition:**  
- Ansible is an **open-source automation tool** used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.  
- Developed by **Red Hat**, it simplifies IT operations by allowing infrastructure-as-code (IaC).  

âœ… **Agentless Architecture:**  
- Unlike Puppet or Chef, Ansible **does not require agents** on managed nodes.  
- Uses **SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows)** for communication.  

âœ… **Idempotency:**  
- Running the same playbook multiple times **wonâ€™t change the system** if the desired state is already met.  
- Example: Installing a package only if itâ€™s not already present.  

âœ… **Use Cases:**  
- **Configuration Management** (e.g., enforcing server settings).  
- **Application Deployment** (e.g., deploying web apps).  
- **Orchestration** (e.g., managing multi-tier applications).

## **Lesson 1.2: Ansible vs. Other Tools**  
| Feature       | Ansible         | Puppet/Chef       | SaltStack       |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Agent**    | No (SSH-based) | Yes (Agent req.)  | Optional Agent |
| **Language** | YAML           | Ruby (Puppet DSL) | YAML/Python    |
| **Ease**     | Easy to Learn  | Steeper Learning | Moderate       |
| **Speed**    | Fast for small setups | Scalable for large infra | High performance |

ðŸ”¹ **Why Choose Ansible?**  
âœ” No need to install extra software on servers.  
âœ” Human-readable YAML syntax.  
âœ” Large community and modules.

## **Lesson 1.3: Ansible Architecture**  
### **Core Components:**  
1. **Control Node**  
   - The machine where Ansible is installed.  
   - Runs playbooks and commands.  

2. **Managed Nodes (Hosts)**  
   - Servers/devices controlled by Ansible.  

3. **Inventory**  
   - A file (`/etc/ansible/hosts`) listing all managed nodes.  
   - Example:  
     ```ini
     [webservers]
     web1.example.com
     web2.example.com

     [dbservers]
     db1.example.com
     ```

4. **Modules**  
   - Small programs Ansible executes (e.g., `copy`, `yum`, `service`).  

5. **Playbooks**  
   - YAML files defining automation tasks.  

6. **Plugins**  
   - Extend Ansibleâ€™s functionality (e.g., `aws_ec2` for cloud).

## **Hands-On Lab 1: Verify Ansible Setup**  
### **Task:**  
1. Install Ansible on your control node (Ubuntu example):  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y
   ```
2. Check Ansible version:  
   ```bash
   ansible --version
   ```
3. Create a basic inventory file (`~/inventory.ini`):  
   ```ini
   [local]
   localhost ansible_connection=local
   ```
4. Test connectivity:  
   ```bash
   ansible -i ~/inventory.ini local -m ping
   ```
   **Expected Output:**  
   ```
   localhost | SUCCESS => { "changed": false, "ping": "pong" }
   ```

## **Summary & Next Steps**  
âœ” Ansible is **agentless, idempotent, and YAML-based**.  
âœ” It outperforms Puppet/Chef in simplicity for small-to-medium setups.  
âœ” Core components: **Control Node, Inventory, Modules, Playbooks**.  

**Next Module:** **Setting Up Ansible (Installation, Inventory, SSH Config)**

### **Quiz (Check Your Understanding)**  
1. What does "idempotency" mean in Ansible?  
2. Why is Ansible considered "agentless"?  
3. What is the default inventory file location?
