# Phase 1 - Python Foundations

Excellent — let’s dive into Phase 1: Python Foundations.

This phase builds your core fluency in Python — by the end, you’ll be able to read, write, and debug real programs comfortably.

Duration: 3 months (about 12 weeks, ~10–15 hours/week).

# **🧩 Phase 1 — Python Foundations (Months 1–3)**

# **🎯**

# **Goal**

Be able to:

- Write basic Python programs from scratch
- Use core data structures correctly
- Read and manipulate files
- Use built-in modules and virtual environments
- Build 2–3 small automation or CLI projects

# **📆**

# **Week-by-Week Breakdown**

**Month 1: Python Basics & Core Syntax**

**🗓**

**Weeks 1–2: The Language Fundamentals**

Topics:

- Installing Python 3.12+
- Python REPL, scripts, VS Code setup
- Syntax, indentation, variables, comments
- Data types: int, float, str, bool, None
- Operators and expressions
- Input/output (input(), print())
- Type conversion (int(), str(), float())

Practice:

- Simple calculator
- Temperature converter (C ↔ F)
- String formatter (name, age, etc.)

Resources:

- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Ch. 1–2
- Python official tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

**🗓**

**Weeks 3–4: Collections & Control Flow**

Topics:

- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Loops (for, while)
- Conditionals (if, elif, else)
- Membership operators (in, not in)
- Iterating collections
- Basic list/dict comprehension

Practice:

- Find duplicates in a list
- Word frequency counter
- Menu-driven CLI (choose from several actions)

Mini Project #1:

📂 File Organizer: Script that scans a folder and moves files into subfolders by type (e.g., images, documents, videos).

**Month 2: Functions, Modules & Files**

**🗓**

**Weeks 5–6: Functions & Scoping**

Topics:

- Defining functions (def)
- Arguments, return values, default values
- Variable scope and lifetime
- Lambda functions
- Recursion basics
- Code style: PEP 8

Practice:

- Fibonacci generator (recursive & iterative)
- Prime number checker
- Refactor earlier projects into functions

Resources:

- Python Crash Course — Ch. 7–8
- PEP 8 style guide: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

**🗓**

**Weeks 7–8: Modules & File I/O**

Topics:

- Imports and standard library overview (os, sys, math, datetime)
- Reading and writing text files
- Working with CSV and JSON
- Exception handling (try, except, finally)
- Intro to virtual environments and pip

Practice:

- JSON-based settings file loader
- CSV contact list
- CLI app that logs actions to a text file

Mini Project #2:

🔐 Password Manager (Local Only)

Store and retrieve encrypted passwords in a JSON file using the cryptography library.

**Month 3: Problem Solving & Integration**

**🗓**

**Weeks 9–10: Problem Solving Patterns**

Topics:

- String processing
- List comprehensions
- Nested data structures
- Built-in functions (map, filter, zip, enumerate)
- Debugging and print() vs pdb

Practice:

- Text analyzer (word count, most common word)
- Palindrome checker
- Log file parser

**🗓**

**Weeks 11–12: Integration Project**

Mini Project #3 — CLI Tool

🧮 Expense Tracker / To-Do Manager

- Store items (JSON or CSV)
- Add/remove/view items from the command line
- Include simple reporting (totals, completion rate)
- Handle invalid input gracefully

Stretch Goal:

Convert this into a simple GUI using tkinter.

# **🧠**

# **Key Skills to Master by End of Phase 1**

✅ Confident use of data structures

✅ Read and write files

✅ Write reusable functions

✅ Handle errors safely

✅ Manage dependencies

✅ Build & run Python scripts from CLI

# **🧰**

# **Tools to Learn**

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| VS Code / PyCharm | Main IDE |
| Git + GitHub | Version control |
| pip + venv | Dependency & environment management |
| Python REPL / IPython | Quick testing |
| Black / Ruff / isort | Code formatting (optional) |

# **🧗‍♂️**

# **End-of-Phase Challenge**

Build a mini automation suite containing:

1. File organizer
2. To-do/Expense tracker
3. Password manager

Bundle them under a simple command-line menu so you can pick which one to run.

Make it a GitHub repo — this becomes your first portfolio piece.

Would you like me to turn this Phase 1 plan into a weekly study schedule (e.g., “Week 1: day-by-day tasks and exercises”)?

That version would make it easier to follow step-by-step daily.
