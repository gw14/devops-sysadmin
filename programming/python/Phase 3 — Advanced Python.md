# Phase 3 — Advanced Python

Awesome — you’re now moving into Phase 3: Advanced Python 👏

At this level, the goal is to transform from a “skilled developer” into a Python expert who can build scalable, performant, production-grade systems and understand the why behind Python’s behavior.

This phase (Months 7–9) will focus on performance, concurrency, design patterns, and architecture — the skills that separate professional coders from experts.

# **🚀**

# **Phase 3 — Advanced Python (Months 7–9)**

# **🎯**

# **Goal**

By the end of this phase, you’ll:

- Master advanced language features (iterators, decorators, metaclasses, etc.)
- Understand and apply design patterns
- Write efficient, concurrent, and optimized code
- Build robust, extensible, large-scale systems
- Publish and distribute your own Python package

# **📆**

# **Month-by-Month Overview**

| **Month** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| Month 7 | Advanced language features & functional programming |
| Month 8 | Concurrency, async programming, and performance |
| Month 9 | Design patterns, packaging, and architecture project |

# **🧩**

# **Month 7 — Deep Python Internals & Advanced Techniques**

**🗓**

**Weeks 25–26: Advanced Language Constructs**

Topics:

- Iterators & generators (__iter__, yield)
- Decorators (function & class-based)
- Context managers (with, __enter__, __exit__)
- Closures & higher-order functions
- Comprehensions & generator expressions

Practice:

- Custom iterator for Fibonacci or prime numbers
- Timer decorator to measure function execution time
- Context manager for temporary file operations

Resources:

- Fluent Python (Ch. 7–10)
- Real Python: [Generators and Iterators](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/)

**🗓**

**Weeks 27–28: Functional Programming & Type Safety**

Topics:

- Functional programming patterns (map, filter, reduce, functools)
- Immutability, dataclasses, and NamedTuple
- Static typing with mypy and typing module
- Clean code & refactoring practices

Practice:

- Refactor an old project using dataclasses
- Add static typing to a module and run mypy
- Implement a pipeline using pure functions

Mini Project #1:

🧮 Data Pipeline Framework (Mini Version)

Create a modular data processing pipeline:

- Each step is a callable (e.g., load → transform → save)
- Supports logging and error handling
- Optionally parallelize with threads later

# **⚙️**

# **Month 8 — Concurrency, Parallelism, and Performance**

**🗓**

**Weeks 29–30: Async & Concurrent Programming**

Topics:

- Difference between threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio
- threading and queue
- concurrent.futures for parallel execution
- asyncio fundamentals (event loop, coroutines, tasks)
- Async I/O (aiohttp, asyncio.gather)

Practice:

- Download multiple web pages concurrently
- Async API client (e.g., fetch cryptocurrency prices)
- Compare sync vs. async performance

Resources:

- Official [asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- Real Python: [Async IO in Python](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)

**🗓**

**Weeks 31–32: Profiling, Optimization & Memory**

Topics:

- Measuring performance (timeit, cProfile)
- Code optimization techniques
- Memory profiling (tracemalloc, memory_profiler)
- Lazy evaluation & caching (functools.lru_cache)
- Working with NumPy for performance

Practice:

- Profile and optimize an old script
- Add caching to improve performance
- Compare runtime of list comprehensions vs. generators

Mini Project #2:

⚡ Asynchronous Web Scraper

- Use aiohttp + asyncio to scrape 100+ pages concurrently
- Store data in SQLite
- Measure and log performance before/after optimization

# **🧠**

# **Month 9 — Architecture, Design Patterns & Distribution**

**🗓**

**Weeks 33–34: Design Patterns**

Topics:

- Creational patterns: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- Structural patterns: Adapter, Facade, Proxy
- Behavioral patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command
- Dependency injection & composition over inheritance

Practice:

- Implement a plugin system using Strategy pattern
- Build a notification system with Observer pattern

Resources:

- Refactoring.Guru — [Design Patterns in Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/python)
- Head First Design Patterns (adapted to Python)

**🗓**

**Weeks 35–36: Packaging, Distribution & Large-Scale Design**

Topics:

- Creating Python packages (setup.py, pyproject.toml, poetry)
- Versioning, changelogs, semantic versioning
- Writing documentation with Sphinx or MkDocs
- CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions)
- Software architecture principles (modularity, SOLID, separation of concerns)

Mini Project #3 — Advanced Capstone

🧩 Custom Python Library / Toolkit

Build and publish a small but useful Python library:

- Includes clear folder structure
- Has logging, tests, and documentation
- Published on PyPI or as a GitHub package

Examples:

- Utility library for file organization
- Async API client
- Lightweight data processing toolkit

# **🧗‍♂️**

# **End-of-Phase Challenge:**

Create a multi-module Python application demonstrating:

1. Asynchronous data fetching
2. OOP architecture with design patterns
3. Type annotations & static analysis
4. Logging and testing
5. Packaging and documentation

Publish it publicly (GitHub + PyPI if possible).

This is your “Advanced Python Developer” milestone — the point where you can design systems end-to-end.

# **🧰**

# **Tools to Master**

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| asyncio / aiohttp | Asynchronous programming |
| threading / multiprocessing | Concurrency & parallelism |
| mypy, pylint, black | Code quality & typing |
| pytest-benchmark, cProfile | Performance testing |
| poetry / setuptools | Packaging & dependency management |
| Sphinx / MkDocs | Documentation generation |

# **🧩**

# **Key Skills by End of Phase 3**

✅ Deep understanding of Python internals

✅ Async & concurrent programming mastery

✅ Packaged and distributed software

Would you like me to create a weekly or daily study plan for Phase 3 (like a “Week 25–26: daily exercises + readings + mini-project breakdown”)?

That would make it easy to follow and track progress step-by-step.
