# Python expert course

Perfect — let’s build you a 1-year roadmap to becoming a Python expert, with a clear structure, milestones, resources, and project ideas.

This roadmap assumes ~10–15 hours/week of consistent effort, but you can adjust pace as needed.

# **🧭 OVERVIEW**

You’ll go through 4 main phases:

1. Foundation (Months 1–3): Syntax, data types, control flow, core libraries.
2. Intermediate Skills (Months 4–6): OOP, modules, testing, automation, APIs.
3. Advanced Topics (Months 7–9): Performance, concurrency, design patterns, architecture.
4. Expert Projects & Specialization (Months 10–12): Real-world systems and one deep specialization.

# **🏗️ Phase 1 — Foundations (Months 1–3)**

**🎯 Goal: Write clean, efficient Python scripts and understand core concepts.**

**Topics:**

- Python syntax, indentation, variables, and types
- Data structures: list, dict, set, tuple
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions, scopes, lambda expressions
- String manipulation and formatting
- Basic file handling (open/read/write)
- Virtual environments and pip
- Modules: os, sys, math, datetime

**Tools:**

- Python 3.12+
- VS Code or PyCharm
- Git + GitHub

**Resources:**

- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (book)
- Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes
- Official Python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/

**Projects:**

1. CLI to-do app
2. File organizer (sort files by extension/date)
3. Simple password manager (with encryption)

# **⚙️ Phase 2 — Intermediate (Months 4–6)**

**🎯 Goal: Build modular, testable, API-integrated applications.**

**Topics:**

- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, dunder methods)
- Error handling and custom exceptions
- File formats: JSON, CSV, XML
- Virtual environments & dependency management
- Unit testing (unittest / pytest)
- Logging and debugging
- HTTP requests (requests), APIs, and web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- Basic databases (SQLite, sqlite3)
- Command-line tools (argparse, click)

**Resources:**

- Fluent Python (Luciano Ramalho, start reading)
- Real Python tutorials
- pytest and requests docs

**Projects:**

1. CLI GitHub repo stats fetcher
2. REST API client (consume and display data from a public API)
3. Personal finance tracker (store data in SQLite)

# **🚀 Phase 3 — Advanced (Months 7–9)**

**🎯 Goal: Master performance, scalability, and design.**

**Topics:**

- Advanced OOP (abstract classes, mixins, interfaces)
- Functional programming concepts
- Iterators, generators, decorators, context managers
- Asyncio, threading, multiprocessing
- Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Type hints, static analysis (mypy, pylint)
- Memory management, profiling (cProfile)
- Packaging & publishing (setuptools, poetry)
- Working with filesystems, sockets, and subprocesses

**Resources:**

- Effective Python (Brett Slatkin)
- Design Patterns in Python (YouTube/Refactoring.Guru)
- Python AsyncIO documentation

**Projects:**

1. Web scraper + async pipeline
2. Chat server/client using sockets
3. Custom library/package (publish on PyPI)

# **🧠 Phase 4 — Expert Level & Specialization (Months 10–12)**

**🎯 Goal: Build production-grade systems, pick a specialization.**

**Core:**

- Testing strategies (unit/integration/CI/CD)
- Code optimization and profiling
- Architecture design and modularization
- Versioning, packaging, documentation

**Choose a specialization:**

Pick one path depending on your career goals:

| **Track** | **Focus** | **Tools** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧩 Web Dev | Backend apps, REST APIs | FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy |
| 🤖 AI/ML | Machine learning, data analysis | NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch |
| 💾 Data Engineering | ETL, pipelines, big data | Airflow, Spark, Kafka |
| ⚙️ DevOps | Automation, scripting, infra | Docker, Ansible, AWS SDK |
| 🧬 Systems | Networking, low-level tools | asyncio, sockets, C extensions |

**Final Projects:**

- Build a full web app or data pipeline
- Create a public GitHub portfolio
- Write documentation, add tests, and deploy

# **🕒 Example Yearly Timeline**

| **Month** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| 1–3 | Core syntax, basic projects |
| 4–6 | OOP, APIs, testing |
| 7–9 | Advanced Python, async, design patterns |
| 10–12 | Specialization + capstone project |

# **🧩 Additional Tips**

- Daily practice: 30–60 minutes of coding every day (LeetCode, HackerRank).
- Read code: Study open-source Python projects.
- Write a blog/journal: Explaining topics solidifies understanding.
- Contribute to open source: Even small bug fixes help.
- Automate your life: Any repetitive task = Python script opportunity.

Would you like me to tailor this roadmap for a specific goal (e.g., backend developer, data scientist, automation engineer)? That way I can adjust the tools and projects accordingly.
