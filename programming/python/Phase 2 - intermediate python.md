# Phase 2 - intermediate python

Perfect — since you’ve completed (or are planning to complete) Phase 1, you’re now ready for Phase 2: Intermediate Python.

This phase transforms you from “comfortable beginner” to independent developer — able to structure larger programs, use APIs, handle data, and write clean, testable code.

# **⚙️**

# **Phase 2 — Intermediate Python (Months 4–6)**

# **🎯**

# **Goal**

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:

- Design modular applications using OOP
- Handle errors, logging, and testing
- Work with APIs and web data
- Build small data-driven applications
- Automate real-world workflows

# **📆**

# **Month-by-Month Overview**

| **Month** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| Month 4 | OOP, exceptions, modular code |
| Month 5 | Files, data formats, and external APIs |
| Month 6 | Testing, CLI tools, databases, and an integration project |

# **🧩**

# **Month 4 — Object-Oriented Programming & Code Organization**

**🗓**

**Weeks 13–14: Deep Dive into OOP**

Topics:

- Classes and objects
- Instance vs. class variables
- Methods and constructors (__init__)
- Encapsulation and access modifiers
- Magic/dunder methods (__str__, __repr__, __len__, etc.)

Practice:

- Model a simple BankAccount class
- Build a Deck of cards simulation
- Custom string wrapper class with overridden operators

Resources:

- Fluent Python, Ch. 5–7
- Real Python: [OOP in Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

**🗓**

**Weeks 15–16: Inheritance, Modules, and Error Handling**

Topics:

- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract base classes (abc module)
- Composition vs. inheritance
- Creating and importing your own modules
- Exception hierarchy and custom exceptions
- Logging (logging module)

Practice:

- Create a Shape hierarchy (Circle, Rectangle, etc.)
- Add error handling to file operations
- Add logging to your previous projects

Mini Project #1:

🧮 Inventory Management System

Use OOP to manage products, stock levels, and transaction logs.

Incorporate file storage (JSON/CSV) and logging.

# **📂**

# **Month 5 — Data Handling & APIs**

**🗓**

**Weeks 17–18: Data Formats & External Libraries**

Topics:

- Reading/writing JSON, CSV, and XML
- Working with datetime and timezones
- Data manipulation with pandas (intro)
- Handling command-line arguments (argparse)

Practice:

- Parse a CSV file of contacts or expenses
- Convert JSON to CSV and vice versa
- Command-line CSV filter using argparse

Resources:

- Python Standard Library docs (csv, json, datetime)
- Pandas official getting started: [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/)

**🗓**

**Weeks 19–20: APIs & Web Data**

Topics:

- requests library for HTTP requests
- Handling JSON responses
- Working with REST APIs
- Intro to web scraping with BeautifulSoup

Practice:

- Query a public API (e.g. OpenWeather, GitHub, TMDB)
- Save API data to JSON
- Build a CLI “Weather App” using live API data

Mini Project #2:

🌐 GitHub API Dashboard

- Fetch user repos, commits, and stars using GitHub’s REST API
- Store data locally and display summaries (top repos, total stars)
- Include error handling for bad requests

# **🧪**

# **Month 6 — Testing, Databases, and CLI Tools**

**🗓**

**Weeks 21–22: Testing & Automation**

Topics:

- Unit testing with unittest and pytest
- Test-driven development (TDD) basics
- Mocking and fixtures
- Writing reusable utility modules
- Refactoring for readability and testability

Practice:

- Write tests for your previous projects
- Mock API calls with pytest
- Automate file backups with a scheduled script

Resources:

- Real Python: [Testing Your Code](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)
- Effective Python, Ch. on Testing

**🗓**

**Weeks 23–24: Databases & Final Integration Project**

Topics:

- SQLite with sqlite3 module
- CRUD operations
- Using ORM (optional intro to SQLAlchemy)
- CLI menus with click or argparse
- Putting everything together

Mini Project #3 — CLI Data App

📘 Personal Finance Tracker (v2)

Features:

- Store expenses/income in SQLite
- Add, remove, update, and search transactions
- Generate monthly summaries
- Command-line menu or argument-based interface
- Include logging, error handling, and unit tests

Stretch Goal:

Add API integration (e.g., currency conversion using an external API).

# **🧠**

# **Key Skills to Master by End of Phase 2**

✅ OOP design principles

✅ Exception handling & logging

✅ Using REST APIs and JSON

✅ Automated testing with pytest

✅ Building CLI tools with arguments

✅ Basic database handling with SQLite

# **🧰**

# **Tools to Learn**

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| pytest | Unit testing |
| requests | API interaction |
| BeautifulSoup | Web scraping |
| sqlite3 / SQLAlchemy | Databases |
| argparse / click | CLI argument parsing |
| logging | Application logs |
| pandas | Basic data manipulation |

# **🧗‍♂️**

# **End-of-Phase Challenge**

Create a data-driven command-line suite with:

1. API data fetching (e.g., GitHub, Weather)
2. Local database (SQLite)
3. Unit tests
4. Logging & error handling
5. Clean modular structure

Publish the project on GitHub with a README and setup instructions — this becomes your first real-world portfolio project.

Would you like me to create a weekly study schedule for Phase 2 (like “Week 13: Day-by-day tasks + exercises + reading plan”) so you can follow it systematically?
